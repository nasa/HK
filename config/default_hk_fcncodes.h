/**
 * \brief Housekeeping No-Op
 *
 *  \par Description
 *       This command will increment the command execution counter and send an
 *       event containing the version number of the application
 *
 *  \par Command Structure
 *       #CFE_MSG_CommandHeader_t
 *
 *  \par Command Verification
 *       Successful execution of this command may be verified with the
 *       following telemetry:
 *       - #HK_HkTlm_Payload_t.CmdCounter will increment
 *       - The #HK_NOOP_CMD_EID informational event message will be generated
 *
 *  \par Error Conditions
 *       There are no error conditions for this command. If the Housekeeping
 *       app receives the command, the event is sent (although it
 *       may be filtered by EVS) and the counter is incremented
 *       unconditionally.
 *
 *  \par Criticality
 *       None

/**
 * \brief Housekeeping Reset Counters
 *
 *  \par Description
 *       This command resets the counters within the HK housekeeping telemetry
 *
 *  \par Command Structure
 *       #CFE_MSG_CommandHeader_t
 *
 *  \par Command Verification
 *       Successful execution of this command may be verified with the
 *       following telemetry:
 *       - #HK_HkTlm_Payload_t.CmdCounter will be reset
 *       - The #HK_RESET_CNTRS_CMD_EID informational event message will
 *         be generated
 *
 *  \par Error Conditions
 *       There are no error conditions for this command. If the Housekeeping
 *       App receives the command, the event is sent (although it
 *       may be filtered by EVS) and the counter is incremented
 *       unconditionally.
 *
 *  \par Criticality
 *       This command is not inherently dangerous.  However, it is
 *       possible for ground systems and on-board safing procedures
 *       to be designed such that they react to changes in the counter
 *       values that are reset by this command.
